# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature adds a comprehensive solicitation parsing pipeline to the AI-Powered Research Team Matching & Assembly System. The pipeline will automatically extract structured data from various document formats (PDF, Word, text) containing research solicitations, funding opportunities, and grant proposals. This eliminates manual data entry and ensures consistent, accurate extraction of key information needed for the team matching algorithms.

The parsing pipeline will support multiple document types (NSF grants, NIH applications, general RFPs) and provide configurable extraction patterns, validation, and quality scoring to ensure reliable data extraction.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a research administrator, I want to upload solicitation documents in various formats and have the system automatically extract all relevant information, so that I don't need to manually enter solicitation details.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user uploads a PDF solicitation document THEN the system SHALL extract text content and parse structured data
2. WHEN a user uploads a Word document THEN the system SHALL convert and extract structured data
3. WHEN a user uploads a plain text document THEN the system SHALL parse the content for structured data
4. WHEN extraction is complete THEN the system SHALL display a preview of extracted data for user review
5. WHEN extraction fails THEN the system SHALL provide clear error messages and fallback to manual entry

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a system user, I want the parser to recognize different types of solicitation documents (NSF, NIH, general RFPs), so that the extraction uses appropriate patterns and fields for each document type.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a document is uploaded THEN the system SHALL attempt to identify the document type automatically
2. WHEN document type is identified THEN the system SHALL apply appropriate extraction configurations
3. WHEN document type cannot be determined THEN the system SHALL use generic extraction patterns
4. WHEN user manually selects document type THEN the system SHALL override automatic detection
5. IF document type is NSF grant THEN the system SHALL extract NSF-specific fields (proposal ID, program, PI details, budget breakdown)
6. IF document type is NIH application THEN the system SHALL extract NIH-specific fields (application ID, funding opportunity, specific aims)

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a research administrator, I want the system to extract comprehensive solicitation information including administrative details, project requirements, budget information, and compliance requirements, so that all necessary data is available for team matching.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN parsing administrative information THEN the system SHALL extract proposal/application ID, submission dates, PI information, and institution details
2. WHEN parsing project information THEN the system SHALL extract title, abstract, objectives, methodology, and innovation aspects
3. WHEN parsing budget information THEN the system SHALL extract total budget, personnel costs, equipment costs, and indirect costs
4. WHEN parsing compliance requirements THEN the system SHALL extract human subjects, animal research, and biohazard information
5. WHEN parsing personnel requirements THEN the system SHALL extract co-investigators, collaborators, and required expertise
6. WHEN parsing skill requirements THEN the system SHALL extract and normalize required skills into a standardized checklist format

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want configurable extraction patterns and validation rules, so that the system can be adapted to new document formats and requirements without code changes.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN configuring extraction patterns THEN the system SHALL support regex patterns for field extraction
2. WHEN configuring field types THEN the system SHALL support single value, multiple value, and nested extraction types
3. WHEN configuring validation THEN the system SHALL support required field validation and default values
4. WHEN adding new document types THEN the system SHALL allow configuration without code modification
5. WHEN extraction patterns fail THEN the system SHALL log failures and attempt alternative patterns

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a research administrator, I want quality assessment and validation of extracted data, so that I can trust the accuracy of the parsed information and identify areas needing manual review.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN extraction is complete THEN the system SHALL calculate a completeness score based on filled vs. empty fields
2. WHEN validation runs THEN the system SHALL identify missing required fields and data quality issues
3. WHEN quality score is below threshold THEN the system SHALL flag the document for manual review
4. WHEN displaying extracted data THEN the system SHALL highlight fields with low confidence scores
5. WHEN user reviews extracted data THEN the system SHALL allow manual correction and override of extracted values

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a system user, I want the parsed solicitation data to integrate seamlessly with the existing team matching workflow, so that I can immediately proceed to researcher matching after document upload.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN extraction is complete and validated THEN the system SHALL convert extracted data to the existing Solicitation data model
2. WHEN solicitation data is ready THEN the system SHALL automatically populate the team matching interface
3. WHEN required skills are extracted THEN the system SHALL normalize them to match the existing skill taxonomy
4. WHEN user approves extracted data THEN the system SHALL proceed directly to the researcher matching step
5. WHEN extraction produces incomplete data THEN the system SHALL allow user to complete missing fields before proceeding

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a system user, I want to save and reuse extraction templates, so that I can efficiently process similar documents in the future.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN processing a document successfully THEN the system SHALL offer to save the extraction configuration as a template
2. WHEN user creates a custom template THEN the system SHALL store the configuration for future use
3. WHEN uploading similar documents THEN the system SHALL suggest appropriate saved templates
4. WHEN using a saved template THEN the system SHALL apply the stored extraction patterns and validation rules
5. WHEN template extraction fails THEN the system SHALL fall back to default patterns

### Requirement 8

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want comprehensive logging and monitoring of the parsing pipeline, so that I can troubleshoot issues and improve extraction accuracy over time.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN documents are processed THEN the system SHALL log extraction attempts, successes, and failures
2. WHEN extraction patterns are used THEN the system SHALL track pattern effectiveness and usage statistics
3. WHEN errors occur THEN the system SHALL log detailed error information for debugging
4. WHEN extraction quality varies THEN the system SHALL provide analytics on common failure patterns
5. WHEN system performance is monitored THEN the system SHALL track processing times and resource usage
