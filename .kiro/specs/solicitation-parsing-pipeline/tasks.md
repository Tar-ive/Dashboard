# Implementation Plan

- [x] 1. Build core PDF parsing engine with pattern extraction
  - Create `modules/solicitation_parser.py` following existing module patterns
  - Add PyPDF2 dependency and implement PDF text extraction with error handling
  - Define `ExtractionConfig` dataclass in `data_models.py` for pattern configuration
  - Implement pattern-based extraction methods for title, abstract, skills, and funding info
  - Create `convert_to_solicitation()` method to map extracted data to existing Solicitation model
  - Add quality assessment with confidence scoring and validation logic
  - Test extraction accuracy using real PDF document in `data/test_solicitation.pdf`
  - Implement comprehensive error handling with graceful fallback to manual entry
  - _Requirements: 1.1, 1.5, 3.1, 3.2, 3.6, 4.1, 4.2, 5.1, 5.2, 6.1, 6.2_

- [x] 2. Integrate PDF parsing into Streamlit workflow
  - Add PDF file upload option to existing Step 1 in app.py alongside JSON upload
  - Implement file type detection and route to appropriate parsing method
  - Create extraction preview interface showing parsed solicitation data with edit capabilities
  - Add quality indicators and confidence scores in the UI
  - Implement session state management for parsed solicitation data
  - Add processing spinners, status messages, and user-friendly error handling
  - Enable seamless transition from PDF parsing to existing researcher matching workflow
  - Test complete end-to-end workflow from PDF upload through team assembly
  - _Requirements: 1.4, 5.4, 6.3, 6.4, 8.4_

- [x] 3. Add advanced features and optimization
  - Implement Streamlit caching for PDF text extraction performance
  - Add template system for saving and reusing extraction configurations
  - Extend support for Word documents (.docx) and plain text files
  - Create comprehensive logging and monitoring for parsing operations
  - Add document type auto-detection and document-specific extraction patterns
  - Implement performance optimization and memory usage monitoring
  - Create template management interface and usage analytics
  - Add comprehensive testing suite and validation against multiple document types
  - _Requirements: 2.1, 2.2, 2.3, 7.1, 7.2, 7.3, 8.1, 8.2, 8.3_
