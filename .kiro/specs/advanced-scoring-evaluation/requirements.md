# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature adds comprehensive evaluation and testing capabilities to validate the existing sophisticated scoring algorithm in the AI-Powered Research Team Matching & Assembly System. The current system implements a complex mathematical model including recency weights, grant experience factors, academic expertise scores, conceptual scoring with expertise density models, and team coverage optimization.

However, the system lacks validation frameworks, test cases, and evaluation metrics to verify that this sophisticated scoring algorithm is performing correctly and producing high-quality matches. This feature will create comprehensive testing, benchmarking, and evaluation systems to ensure the existing scoring algorithms are working as intended and producing reliable results.
