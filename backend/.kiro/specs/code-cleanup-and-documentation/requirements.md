# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature focuses on organizing the codebase structure, cleaning up loose files, and updating API documentation to improve maintainability and developer experience. The project currently has several organizational issues including loose test files in the root directory, scattered documentation files, and potentially outdated API documentation that need to be addressed systematically.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer working on this project, I want the codebase to have a clean and logical file organization, so that I can easily navigate and understand the project structure.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN examining the root directory THEN the system SHALL have only essential configuration files and no loose test scripts
2. WHEN looking for test files THEN the system SHALL have all test files organized in the appropriate tests/ directory structure
3. WHEN reviewing documentation THEN the system SHALL have all documentation files organized in a dedicated docs/ directory
4. IF there are utility scripts THEN the system SHALL have them organized in the scripts/ directory with clear naming conventions
5. WHEN examining the data/ directory THEN the system SHALL have cleaned up any unnecessary uploaded files while preserving essential data

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer integrating with the API, I want comprehensive and up-to-date API documentation, so that I can understand all available endpoints and their usage.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN accessing the API documentation THEN the system SHALL provide complete OpenAPI/Swagger documentation for all endpoints
2. WHEN reviewing endpoint documentation THEN the system SHALL include request/response examples for each endpoint
3. WHEN examining API models THEN the system SHALL have detailed schema documentation with field descriptions
4. IF an endpoint has specific error conditions THEN the system SHALL document all possible error responses
5. WHEN looking at authentication requirements THEN the system SHALL clearly document any authentication or authorization requirements

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a new developer joining the project, I want clear project documentation and setup instructions, so that I can quickly understand and contribute to the project.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN reviewing project documentation THEN the system SHALL have a comprehensive README.md with project overview and setup instructions
2. WHEN looking for development guidelines THEN the system SHALL have clear contributing guidelines and coding standards
3. WHEN examining the project structure THEN the system SHALL have documentation explaining the architecture and key components
4. IF there are environment variables required THEN the system SHALL document all required configuration options
5. WHEN setting up the development environment THEN the system SHALL provide clear step-by-step instructions

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a maintainer of the project, I want consistent code organization and naming conventions, so that the codebase remains maintainable as it grows.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN examining file naming THEN the system SHALL follow consistent naming conventions across all directories
2. WHEN reviewing import statements THEN the system SHALL have clean and logical import paths
3. WHEN looking at directory structure THEN the system SHALL follow Python project best practices
4. IF there are configuration files THEN the system SHALL be organized logically with clear separation of concerns
5. WHEN examining utility functions THEN the system SHALL be properly categorized and documented

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer running tests, I want all test files properly organized and easily discoverable, so that I can run specific test suites efficiently.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN running pytest THEN the system SHALL discover all tests from the proper tests/ directory structure
2. WHEN examining test organization THEN the system SHALL have tests grouped by functionality (api, services, models, etc.)
3. WHEN looking for test utilities THEN the system SHALL have shared test utilities in appropriate locations
4. IF there are manual test scripts THEN the system SHALL be clearly labeled and organized in a dedicated directory
5. WHEN running test coverage THEN the system SHALL exclude non-production files from coverage reports
