#Suggested Changes
1. Collapse these. Start with just api/, models/, services/, and a new tasks/ directory for your background jobs. Let the need for a core or processors directory emerge organically if a service file becomes too large or if you find yourself repeating low-level logic across multiple services.
2. Delete the app/api/v1/ directory entirely and keep all your API route handlers directly within app/api/. This simplifies the structure and removes ambiguity.
