# GROQ API Key Integration Summary

## Changes Made

### 1. Added python-dotenv dependency
- Added `python-dotenv>=1.0.0` to `requirements.txt`
- This allows loading environment variables from `.env` file

### 2. Updated app.py
- Added `from dotenv import load_dotenv` and `load_dotenv()` at the top
- Added debugging statements to show GROQ_API_KEY loading status
- Environment variables are now loaded before any other imports

### 3. Updated modules/report_generator.py
- Added `from dotenv import load_dotenv` and `load_dotenv()` at the top
- Modified `__init__` method to use `os.getenv("GROQ_API_KEY")` as fallback
- Added detailed debugging statements showing key length and initialization status
- Updated Groq model from `llama3-8b-8192` to `llama-3.3-70b-versatile` (current model)

### 4. Updated modules/enhanced_skill_extractor.py
- Added `import os` and dotenv loading at the top
- Modified `__init__` method to use `os.getenv("GROQ_API_KEY")` as fallback
- Added detailed debugging statements for API key loading and client initialization
- Updated Groq model from `llama-3.1-70b-versatile` to `llama-3.3-70b-versatile` (current model)

### 5. Updated test files
- Updated `test_enhanced_skill_extractor.py` to load environment variables
- Updated `test_streamlit_integration.py` to load environment variables
- Added debugging statements to show GROQ_API_KEY loading status in tests

## Environment Setup

### .env file contains:
```
GROQ_API_KEY=your_groq_api_key_here
```

## Testing Results

### ✅ GROQ API Key Loading
- Environment variables are loaded successfully across all modules
- API key length: [REDACTED]
- Key starts with: [REDACTED]

### ✅ Groq Client Initialization
- ReportGenerator initializes Groq client successfully
- EnhancedSkillExtractor initializes Groq client successfully
- Both modules show detailed debugging information

### ✅ Model Updates
- Updated from deprecated `llama-3.1-70b-versatile` to current `llama-3.3-70b-versatile`
- Updated from `llama3-8b-8192` to `llama-3.3-70b-versatile` for consistency
- LLM extraction now works properly with the updated models

### ✅ Skill Extraction Testing
- Enhanced skill extraction works with both LLM and OpenAlex models
- Dual-model validation produces high-quality results
- Fallback mechanisms work when API calls fail

## Debug Output Examples

When running the application, you'll see debug output like:
```
✅ GROQ_API_KEY loaded successfully (length: 56)
✅ Groq API client initialized for strategic analysis (key length: 56)
✅ Groq client initialized successfully (key length: 56)
✅ LLM extracted 8 skills
```

## Usage

The GROQ API key is now automatically loaded from the `.env` file throughout the project. No manual configuration is needed - just ensure the `.env` file exists in the project root with the correct API key.

All modules that use the Groq API will:
1. Load environment variables using python-dotenv
2. Check for GROQ_API_KEY in environment
3. Initialize the Groq client with proper error handling
4. Provide detailed debugging information
5. Fall back gracefully if the API is unavailable
